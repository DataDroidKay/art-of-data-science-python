# art-of-data-science-python
A python resource for the book Art of Data Science by Roger D. Peng and Elizabeth Matsui

**Note**: The notebook is still a work in progress. At the moment due to some mismatches in the data stated in the book and the one on the resource website, it will remain partially unfinished. Hope to get some feedback from authors about this mismatch.
